# AI Agent Harness

A GitHub template for autonomous AI coding agents. Docker-isolated runs, beads-based task tracking, and iterative implementation from a spec.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a repo from this template** (or clone directly)
2. **Write your spec** in `SPEC.md` — describe what you want built
3. **Set up credentials**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
   ```
4. **Run the agent**:
   ```bash
   scripts/run.sh
   ```

The agent reads your spec, creates tasks via beads, implements them, and pushes code.

## Modes

### Single Run (`scripts/run.sh`)

Runs the agent once. It picks up existing tasks or creates new ones from the spec.

```bash
scripts/run.sh
```

### Loop (`scripts/run-loop.sh`)

Runs the agent in a tight loop — back-to-back runs with no gap by default.

```bash
scripts/run-loop.sh          # No delay between runs
scripts/run-loop.sh 300      # 5-min delay between runs
```

### Epic (`scripts/run-epic.sh`)

Runs a task loop for a specific epic. Creates a feature branch and works through each child task.

```bash
scripts/run-epic.sh <epic-id>              # 15-min timeout per task
scripts/run-epic.sh <epic-id> 30           # 30-min timeout per task
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Git with SSH access to your repo
- `bd` (beads) CLI — [github.com/steveyegge/beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)
- An Anthropic API key or Claude Code OAuth token

## Customization

### Adding project dependencies

The agent can modify `scripts/runner/Dockerfile` to add whatever your project needs (Python, Rust, system packages, etc.). You can also edit it manually before running.

### Task tracking

All work is tracked via beads (`bd`). The agent creates epics and tasks, marks them in-progress, and closes them on completion. Run `bd list` to see current state.

### Git hooks

The pre-commit hook at `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` runs beads sync. Add project-specific checks (linting, tests) as needed.

## How It Works

1. **Host script** builds a Docker container, mounts SSH agent + persistent Claude volume
2. **Container** clones the repo fresh, initializes beads, runs Claude Code with a prompt
3. **Claude** reads `SPEC.md`, checks beads for tasks, implements work, commits, pushes
4. **Host script** pulls the changes after the container finishes
